                <h2><i class="fad fa-share"></i>Organizational Transparency</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    To ensure transparency, efficiency and overall effectiveness, the organization pursed a rigorous internal control system. International norms and practices are meticulously followed. These practices reflect the organization’s institutional and managerial soundness. 
                            The organization has a strong and justified HR Rules and an established & well defined organogram which drives  all Programs/Components/Departments to achieve its long term goal. A program or department consists of several components which have been functioning through the proper guidelines as per established regulation
                            For maintain transparency and Good Governance organization follows:
                            •	Strategic Vision/Missions: Organization  has a strategic vision and mission 
                            •	Responsiveness: Ensure serving interest of all stakeholders
                            •	Transparency: Liberty of information between the organization and stakeholders.

                            •	Compliance: Strictly follow the directives of registration  Authority 
                            We publish quarterly reports that give more analytical updates on the progress of all of our programs, and at the end of each year we publish an impact assessment for each of our programs in each areas where we work. These impact assessments include recommended adjustments for each program moving forward.
                            In today’s age of technology and hyper-connectivity, people expect and demand information at their fingertips. For social impact organizations, whose very operations depend on building trust with donors, this means that organizational transparency should be a priority. The more transparent you are with your fundraising community, the more likely its members will trust you and support your mission.
                            In order to increase organizational transparency, we have need to first understand what it means. In an effort to learn more, we talked with three social impact organizations about what transparency means to them and how they bring it to their own operations.
                            We believe organizational transparency means holding ourselves accountable to the people we serve, as well as to the rest of our stakeholders. We believe organizational transparency means sharing successes and failures, reporting with regard to mission and financial stewardship, conducting third party financial audits, and maintaining ongoing monitoring and evaluation of our programs. Transparency is a core value for us .Without transparency, an organization is sending the wrong message to those who are truly interested in what you do and how you do it.
